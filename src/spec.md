# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a new personal-feeling animation/effect to the Valentine page and trigger it at an emotionally relevant moment in the existing flow without changing any copy.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement at least one new visual animation/effect distinct from the existing floating hearts overlay, designed to be non-blocking for interactions and smooth on mobile/desktop.
- Trigger the new effect when the user clicks either proposal button, alongside the existing final-section reveal + smooth scroll behavior.
- Ensure the final section remains hidden on initial load and only reveals after a proposal button click, with all existing user-facing English text unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** When the user clicks “Yes ❤️” or “Of course Yes 💕”, the page reveals the final section as before and also plays an additional personal animation/effect that doesn’t interfere with scrolling, buttons, or audio controls.
