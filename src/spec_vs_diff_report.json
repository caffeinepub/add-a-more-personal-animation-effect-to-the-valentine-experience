  "summary": "Implemented a new PersonalMomentEffect overlay (radial burst + sparkles + heart burst) and integrated it into ValentinePage, triggering it on a proposal click handler. CSS support for the new overlay/effect was added to index.css. One REQ-9 acceptance criterion (both proposal buttons triggering the effect) cannot be fully verified from the truncated diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Clicking either proposal button (“Yes ❤️” or “Of course Yes 💕”) triggers the new effect in addition to the existing final-section reveal + smooth scroll behavior.",
      "reason": "The diff shows the new effect is triggered in `handleYesClick`, but the truncated ValentinePage diff does not show the proposal buttons wiring (i.e., that both buttons call this handler).",
