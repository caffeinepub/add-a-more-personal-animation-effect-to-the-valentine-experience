  "summary": "Implemented a new Custom Domain setup section with domain + canister ID inputs and added runtime URL-based share/copy behavior to support custom domains. One potential gap is that the visible label/navigation entry says \"Custom Domain Setup\" rather than exactly \"Custom Domain\" (as stated in the AC), though an in-page section and a navigation-style button are present.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "A visible navigation entry or in-page section labeled \"Custom Domain\" exists in the app.",
      "reason": "The diff shows a section titled \"Custom Domain Setup\" and a Settings icon/button with aria-label/title \"Custom Domain Setup\". The acceptance criteria explicitly calls for a label \"Custom Domain\"; an exact match is not evidenced.",
